â€˜The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble
history and each has produced outstanding witches and
wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will
earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose
house points. At the end of the year, the house with the
most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I
hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house
becomes yours.
